Notes:
Flattening array: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/flat
1.	Creates a new array with all the sub array by recursively concatenating it upto specified depth
2.	Remote empty slots in an array
Arr = [1, 2, , 4, [2,5]]
Arr.flat() => [1, 2, 4, 2, 5]

3. It is a copying method, it doesnâ€™t alter the array but returns a shallow copy of the array.
4. In this solution, another function called flattened is created to pass the result array and call it recursively.
